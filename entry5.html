						<h6>What did you do this past week?</h6>

						<p>For the first half of this past week, I studied for the
							first exam. After the test, I looked over the material for the
							Integer project and started working on it with Kevin Gao. We
							quickly progressed through all the operations and negative cases
							aside from multiplication and power, which we still need to
							implement. I also finished annotating the provided code on the
							Vector data structure. Although I am quite familiar with it from
							my previous C++ experience, I was still uncertain about a few
							things.</p>

						<h6>What's in your way?</h6>

						<p>We still need to implement the multiplication and power
							operations using the Karatsuba algorithm and ensure we pass all
							the HackerRank test cases, especially the last one that seems to
							greatly stress the program runtime and optimization. I have
							looked into other sources of performance improvement from the
							Java BigInteger documentation, which we may have to also learn if
							the Karatsuba algorithm doesn't provide the necessary speed.</p>

						<h6>What will you do next week?</h6>

						<p>Next week, Kevin and I will focus our efforts on optimizing
							our multiplication and power operations to pass the HackerRank
							tests. We hope we will be able to implement everything without
							much issue, though there is still the possibility that further
							optimizations will be needed. In that case, we will have to do
							additional work to account for those as well.</p>

						<h6>What was your experience of Test #1 and its two-stage nature?</h6>

						<p>I felt very prepared for Test #1 and didn't have any issues
							with the two-stage nature. At first, I heard some negative things
							about how the two parts meant there was less time to answer the
							questions. However, I didn't feel rushed at all as I finished
							both stages with plenty of time to spare. Furthermore, the second
							collaborative part gave me a lot more confidence in my answers
							which made me feel a lot better than usual after a test.</p>

						<h6>How are you doing and holding up? What's been most
							helpful for you in terms of support at this time?</h6>

						<p>I am feeling well, now that the first exam has passed. The
							downtime with no class on Friday really helped me the most, as I
							was able to make up for the hours of sleep sacrificed to study
							again before the exam. It was a great mental reset before
							shifting gears into the Integer project, which I have enjoyed
							working on so far.</p>

						<h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

						<p>It is quite superficial, but my happiest point of this week
							was again related to the card game Hearthstone. I finally was
							able to afford one of my favorite decks (Highlander Priest, for
							those of you who know it), which has brought me a good amount of
							enjoyment in playing the game.</p>

						<h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>

						<p>While working on the Integer project, we ran into a very
							nasty bug pertaining to vectors and iterators. We tried to do a
							push_back operation to grow the vector before iterating over it,
							but we got completely wrong values from the iterator despite the
							vector containing the correct values and everything else
							successfully running. This ended up being caused by iterator
							invalidation, which didn't seem to actually be detected at all by
							the compiler or cppcheck.</p>


						<p>I found <a href="https://thispointer.com/stdvector-and-iterator-invalidation/#:~:text=An%20Iterator%20becomes%20invalidate%20when,to%20vector%20at%20any%20location">this article</a>
							outlining the specific reasons behind the behavior, which all
							makes sense in hindsight. Since push_back grew the vector itself,
							the correct values must have been copied to a larger block of
							memory making the old iterators return bizarre numbers. Hence, we
							learned to always redeclare iterators to be safe, especially when
							working with non-const vectors.
