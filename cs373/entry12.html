                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            This past week, I finished up Phase III with the rest of my team. We struggled a bit with all the work involved in filtering, searching, and sorting but we were able to get all of those requirements working on our site. 
                        </p>

                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Nothing is quite in my way. As a team, we were able to implement all of the hard requirements for Phase III though we did run out of time to add some nicer features. We will definitely have to see our evaluation for our current website and hopefully have a chance to address that last bit of feedback before our final phase.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Next week, I will probably try to get a headstart on the concrete requirements for Phase IV as well as implement some of the features that would be nice to have on our website. Since most of us are quite new to full-stack development, our code base is kinda scattered all over the place so there will definitely be a lot of refactoring to do, both on the exterior and interior of our project.
                        </p>

                        <h6> If you read it, what did you think of the More getters and setters? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I felt that the examples took up a bit too much of the paper, and sifting through them trying to understand everything felt really gritty. It’s definitely more difficult to effectively read code than actually try to write it, but I think thinking in ways outside this getter/setter design pattern is the start to implementing other systems in this more beneficial way. 
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of SQL? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I thought SQL was fairly intuitive and similar to my experience with data in Pandas. I really like the concept of its declarative syntax, and getting what you need out of one line is always satisfying.

                        </p>

                        <h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

                        <p>
                            I think I’m just happy that we were able to get the technical stuff working for Phase III, and finally be able to take a bit of a breather after hitting those certain walls for so long. I’m definitely feeling a bit of burnout with everything that’s going on, but I know I have to stay strong for this final stretch.
                        </p>


                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>

                        <p>My tip-of-the-week is definitely learning a bit about how
                            
                            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/percent-encoding" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">percent encoding</a>

                            works. Our team spent so much time trying to debug why our backend queries involving ‘%’ weren't working with certain combinations like ‘%c%’ or ‘%ca%’. It turns out we needed to percent-encode the actual ‘%’ itself as ‘%25’ because ‘%ca’ and etc was being interpreted as a hexadecimal code. Looking past the pain this managed to cause me, it’s a pretty cool way of expressing special characters and data within the URL.
