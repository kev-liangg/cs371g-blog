                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            The main thing I had to do this past week was refactor my student website to include both
                            this blog and the blogs from Dr. Downing’s Summer 2020 CS 371g. I had to do a lot of voodoo
                            with symbolic links to directories in order to minimally change the actual contents of the
                            html files. I don’t have a lot of web development experience so everything is a good
                            opportunity for me to learn the best design patterns in that regard, and I definitely
                            anticipate it will be helpful in the future of this course.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Nothing is in my way. I was able to smoothly get everything up and running blog-wise and I
                            feel very confident in handling the remaining quizzes and upcoming Collatz project in this
                            class.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I plan to finish Collatz. I don’t anticipate spending much time on the project because I’ve
                            already worked with the concept before, and I am already familiar with Dr. Downing’s
                            workflow having taken one of his courses before.
                        </p>

                        <h6> If you read it, what did you think of the makefile? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I completed Paper #2 on the makefile and I found it very helpful to actually analyze the
                            workings of the commands and the overall composition. Even having taken two courses using
                            Make and makefiles in the workflow I still am not confident in them though. I don’t think I
                            would be able to construct a makefile from scratch for one of my projects without a lot of
                            trial and error and looking things up.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of Docker? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I like Docker, and I think their mascot "Moby Dock" is really cute. I actually used Docker
                            this past semester to set up my own image for my Operating Systems final project to
                            encourage a shared development environment between the group. This didn’t really come to
                            fruition as people tended to develop on the lab machines as well as their local machines,
                            which led to integration challenges at the end. Delving back into Docker in this course
                            really makes me appreciate the benefits of having a universal environment that already
                            contains the necessary toolchains for compiling and testing.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of assertions? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I have a good understanding of assertions and why they are useful. I’ve been conscious about
                            incorporating assertions into my code along with invariants for correctness that can be
                            asserted, which is the approach I am actually currently learning in my Algorithms course.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of unit tests? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I also feel very confident about unit tests. A lot of my extracurriculars focus on unit
                            testing to verify the behavior of embedded systems that we wrote the code for. Having
                            sufficient unit test coverage is crucial to validating all sorts of software and I am glad
                            we are learning about this in our education.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

                        <p>I downloaded an online gambling app called “Robinhood” and put some money into some sort of
                            roulette thing called “Gamestop.” The point of the game seems to be a funny graph that goes
                            up and down randomly. If the graph goes up, so does the money I put in. So far I’ve already
                            made more money than I’ve put in, which I collected already. I still have some leftover
                            money according to the graph, so I think I’m going to wait and see if the casino thing can
                            go up even higher. I’m very happy to have made such easy money in this virtual casino,
                            especially how Las Vegas is such a far drive away.</p>

                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>

                        <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/">This
                            page</a>
                        in the official Docker documentation was very helpful for setting up Dockerfiles and learning
                        about why certain practices are considered the best. There’s a surprising amount of things that
                        go on behind the scenes when setting up a pullable Docker image, and I think it’s even helpful
                        for the end user to try and understand how everything’s set up in that regard.
