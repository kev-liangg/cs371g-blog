                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I didn’t do very much this past week besides doing the usual amount of work in preparing for Spring Break. Fortunately there wasn’t much to do and I was able to get a bit of a break before the break.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I have an algorithms exam on Wednesday, which I will have to start focusing on after we turn in our Phase II work, but other than that nothing is really in my way. The Phase III deadline isn’t too far away though so I will also have to start thinking with my team about how we can make good progress on that given the work we already have.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Next week will definitely be devoted to Phase III once I finish my algorithms exam. There is still a lot regarding our data that could be added and refined, and implementing the functionalities of filtering and searching should be a main priority.
                        </p>

                        <h6> If you read it, what did you think of the Interface Segregation Principle? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I thought the paper addressed an important topic, but could have been a bit more clear at times with the examples. I definitely was able to realize why the given design patterns were bad and why the solutions were optimal, but it took me longer than I would have liked to really follow the examples as they were displayed. Especially in the case study with the ATM transactions, it was really hard for me to follow all the design and inheritance patterns as they were given in the text, and it was only the diagrams that helped with that.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of comprehensions, yield, closures, and decorators? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Iteration and digits iterator were both very straightforward, since they are familiar concepts from Generic Programming. In that same sense, I also had a good grasp of generators and how they worked under the hood to set up and produce the output. Comprehensions were definitely new to me, but I still appreciated their versatility and how they related to the rest of iteration and generation. It will probably just take some time before I get used to their syntax and use cases.

                        </p>

                        <h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

                        <p>
                            A local group of mine got a special connection for helicopter target shooting. That’s right, shooting guns at steel targets while riding in a civilian little-bird helicopter. I know I had to verify that I read it correctly at first. The price was also surprisingly fair, and I could both bring my own guns and use their full-autos; either way, it’s miles cheaper than helicopter hog hunting, which is something I planned to do as a graduation party. Unfortunately the first session is the exact same date as our Phase II deadline so I had to hold off on going, but my bucket list is definitely one item larger now.

                        </p>


                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>


                        <p>My tip-of-the-week is <a href="https://eslint.org/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">ESLint</a>, a static analyzer for Javascript code. 

                                If you used create-react-app for the frontend setup, the scripts actually should have already installed it as a dependency. To set it up, just include "lint": "eslint ." as an entry under the scripts definition in package.json. To call ESLint, simply run either yarn lint or npm lint and it will check the code for problems. 

                                I also added something called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">eslint-plugin-import</a> 
                                
                                to supplement the static analysis, as sometimes our website crashed due to unresolved imports. Using ESLint in our pipeline in place of production building the app has saved us over a minute per pipeline, which really added up across all our commits and jobs.
