                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            This past week I mostly had to sort out some non-academic related affairs aside from the
                            regular homework in my other classes. I set up my environment for the Collatz project but I
                            haven’t had the chance to delve into the work yet.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I don’t think anything’s blocking my way. I’m familiar with Dr. Downing’s workflow as well
                            as the expectations for the Collatz project and I’m confident I’ll make the time to submit
                            everything by the deadline.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I will finish up Collatz for early next week starting ASAP and try to start my other
                            homeworks earlier than usual. I’ve definitely been pushing most of my work closer to the
                            deadlines. I’m usually good at gauging the time I need for each assignment and finishing it
                            comfortably within time, but I should make it a better habit to get things out of the way
                            earlier if I’m confident about how long it will take anyway.
                        </p>

                        <h6> If you read it, what did you think of the Continuous Integration? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I found it mostly interesting to see how the Continuous Integration paper written in 2006
                            stacks up with today’s modern technologies and toolchains. The best practices for software
                            engineering are always changing, and the procedure we’re learning about in this course will
                            definitely become outdated as the industry shifts and adapts. To me, having a more dated
                            paper certainly emphasizes why it is important to understand the underlying reasons that
                            drive the idea of Continuous Integration rather than focus on the specific usage of the
                            technologies themselves.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of Collatz? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I really like the Collatz project and think it’s perfect to start out this class. It applies
                            a lot of what we’re learning in lecture and reading in Perusall in terms of software
                            development best practices, and leaves a lot of independent inquiry into concepts like
                            caching and optimizations.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of exceptions? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I’m comfortable with exceptions as a concept, but of course the implementation is always
                            language-specific. I’ve never worked with exceptions in Python or JavaScript before, so it
                            took me a bit longer to grasp the usage patterns and specific behavior. I will probably have
                            to rewatch the lecture again and walk through the steps before I feel fully confident about
                            exceptions in those contexts.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

                        <p>I scored a perfect 250 points out of 250 on my LTC qualification, which means I can
                            officially start the licensing application soon. I know it’s not difficult to achieve that
                            score, but I’m happy with my groupings despite being a bit out of practice with the current
                            circumstances. There’s definitely room for improvement, but I’m otherwise confident in
                            moving forward with things. My mother has always told me it’s a big responsibility to get
                            licensed; it completely changes one’s habits and perspective. But when it comes to being
                            accountable for my own safety, I know it will all be worth it.</p>

                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>


                        <p>As recruiting season starts back up, my tip-of-the-week is <a href="https://huntr.co/"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huntr</a>. This tool is essentially a one-stop
                            shop to track job applications in a visually appealing and organized manner. I’ve definitely
                            forgotten about several applications before and gotten spooked by an unexpected HackerRank
                            email, so I’m hoping to use this tool in the future as I delve into the much scarier side of
                            full-time job hunting.</p>
