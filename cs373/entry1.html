                        <p>
                            Hi there, I'm Kevin Liang, and this is my first blog entry
                            for Spring 2021's CS373: Software Engineering.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is my second course with Dr. Downing, and I'm sure you can visualize
                            the passage of time with my portraits for each blog!
                        </p>

                        <h6> Where did you grow up? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I grew up in a suburban area near Salt Lake City, Utah. After middle school, my family moved
                            to Scottsdale, Arizona for reasons that I forget now. I attended Desert Mountain High School
                            and graduated under the International Baccalaureate Programme there.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your favorite extracurricular activity in
                            high school? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Besides my school’s FRC robotics team, which I already talked about in previous blog posts,
                            my other favorite extracurricular was Jazz Band. I played the Double Bass in an orchestra as
                            well, but my best experiences came from performing jazz. I loved the combination of keeping
                            time and improvising, as well as the adrenaline rush of taking solos.                             
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>I became very close
                            with the other people in the band, as we stuck together through thick and thin; last-minute
                            rehearsals, cramped bus rides, and the gratifying applause after our best performances. Yet
                            despite all the good memories, we still inevitably drifted apart after high school.
                            Sometimes I wonder if they still remember me, or at least the happier times we went through
                            together.
                        </p>

                        <h6> Why did you come to UT? </h6>

                        <p>
                            In all honesty, I came to UT because I had inted the majority of my college applications and
                            got rejected from all my top schools. I don’t like to think about what I could have done
                            differently in hindsight, but I feel I’m perfectly happy being here at UT. Even if I did
                            have to pay out-of-state tuition at first, I eventually was able to gain Texas residency as
                            I realized that Austin was a great place to be as a Computer Science graduate.
                        </p>

                        <h6> Why are you in this class? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I signed up for this class because I heard great things from other students in Dr. Downing’s
                            Generic Programming course over last summer. I really enjoy Dr. Downing’s lecture style as
                            well as the independent project-focused nature of his courses, so registering as quickly as
                            I can for this course was a no-brainer.
                        </p>

                        <h6> How much Javascript/Python/SQL/Web programming do you already know? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I am only comfortable with Python. I’ve been exposed to Javascript/SQL/Web programming
                            minimally through some aspects of projects. I hope I can pick them up somewhat quickly
                            before the pace of this course starts ramping up.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What are your expectations of this class? </h6>

                        <p>
                            My expectations of this course certainly changed with the first two lectures. I was
                            expecting a similar format compared to Generic Programming, with the two-stage quizzes and
                            exams. I suppose having no exams this semester will reduce the stress there. I’m glad the
                            cold calling system stayed the same, as I feel it made all the lectures much more engaging
                            and effective.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But completely honestly, I feel really bad about the quizzes this semester. Even with the
                            previous two-stage format, they were my highest source of anxiety over the summer. I would
                            wake up in the morning dry heaving, and I needed to skip breakfast on lecture days because I
                            would physically vomit from the stress. I will definitely have to better prepare myself both
                            mentally and physically to get through the quizzes as they are structured now.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What made you happy this week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I finally drove back to my studio in Austin after spending the break with my father and his
                            girlfriend, since I tested negative for covid. I’m just happy because I'll finally be able to interact with 
                            them once in a while, even if it means that I'll be completely alone for the majority of the time living here.
                        </p>
