                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            This past week, I worked on the IDB project with my group. We made good progress in setting up our development environments and hope to be able to deploy to AWS very soon with our Docker, frontend, and backend components.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I have an upcoming Algorithms exam that has been stressing me out, and I can’t wait to get it over with. Other than that nothing is particularly in my way. The rest of the AWS setup seems straightforward enough, so I don’t anticipate it giving us any major issues.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I will work with my group to finish deploying our website to AWS as a first priority. After that, the remaining phase requirements should be more simple work. Our group as a whole has some timezone differences so I think a lot of the work will end up being done asynchronously, making it especially important to use the issue tracker in GitLab moving forward.
                        </p>

                        <h6> If you read it, what did you think of the Pair Programming? </h6>

                        <p>
                            It took me a few times rereading the paper to fully comprehend the message. At first I was a bit confused trying to apply the principles of code reuse I learned in Data Structures, also in the context of Object-Oriented Programming. Splitting responsibilities into multiple classes, even if the classes were ultimately similar, seemed counterproductive to the idea of reusing code. I realized I needed to shift my perspective to a maintenance standpoint, which is something I never had to do explicitly in that course. One should design increasingly-complex systems with the Single Responsibility Principle in mind first, and something simpler like code reuse second.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of IDB1 and reduce? </h6>

                        <p>
                            So far, my experience has been very straightforward. IDB1 has so far required me to learn and research new technologies and toolchains, which is on par with my expectations for this course. Reduce was also fairly simple, as I have gotten used to thinking about data structures in terms of iterator operations. The Python syntax makes iteration fairly easy, though I’m still not a fan of the type ambiguity at times.
                        </p>

                        <h6> How did you fare in the storm? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I was hit pretty hard, and my studio lost water and electricity for a while. Living alone definitely made everything magnitudes more stressful. There were times that I wondered if I could just simply freeze to death, and how long it would be until someone would check on me. Fortunately, I was able to apply for UT emergency housing services and weather out the storm there. In hindsight, I’m glad I dealt with all on my own accord so I didn’t have to be too much of a burden on others.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

                        <p>I’m just happy that things are back to normal and my course schedules have been accommodating in light of the storm. The whole thing really amplified my existing stressors in life, and I’m hoping that they’ll go away eventually as well.</p>

                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>


                        <p>I have been following this interactive <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_get_started.asp" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap walkthrough</a> for the IDB project. It’s fairly beginner-friendly as I’ve been able to comprehend the material with a very minimal knowledge of web programming, and I definitely appreciate the interactive windows to visualize how the code works.</p>
