                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I was able to comfortably make all of my deadlines this past week, including Collatz. I
                            didn't have much else to do so I was able to mentally relax a bit and use my time for other
                            things like hanging out with friends and playing video games.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Nothing is in my way aside from my next set of deadlines in these upcoming weeks. I
                            definitely feel more refreshed with this bit of a break week and break weekend, which should
                            be helpful for getting back into a productive state.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Next week I will probably start on my upcoming projects in my other courses. The main thing
                            at the moment is writing out my group's project proposal for the iOS Mobile Computing
                            course, since that requires a lot of outlining in the deliverables and overall estimation.
                        </p>

                        <h6> If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #4: What Happens to Us? </h6>

                        <p>
                            It was definitely a very heavy paper and speaks magnitudes as to the different experiences
                            men and women have within the field of Computer Science. Even if the specific context was
                            towards higher studies and academia, I have no doubt that women in the working industry
                            experience similar discrimination. Even though we can't control the harmful actions of
                            others, we must all stay vigilant in order to address them when we witness them; only that
                            way can we foster a truly supportive environment where everyone in the field has unfair
                            obstacles removed on their path to merit and success.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of Collatz, exceptions, and strcmp? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Collatz was straightforward as expected, as I had already done this intro project previously
                            with Dr. Downing's other courses. Exceptions were also simple, which is good as it is a
                            powerful component of the language and hence should be easily understandable. Finally, the
                            strcmp exercise definitely was stressful for my entire group because we forgot we had to
                            uncomment all the test definitions and didn't figure that out until mere minutes from the
                            end. Fortunately, the code I wrote worked on the first try; we definitely would not have had
                            time to debug any failures otherwise.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

                        <p>I went on an afternoon tubing trip on the San Marcos River with the Chinese Student
                            Association here at UT. It was great being able to unwind by floating down the river and
                            basking in the sun. I didn't lose any of my possessions nor get burnt, so it was certainly
                            time well spent. </p>

                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>

                        <p>I stumbled upon this <a
                                href="https://philome.la/jace_harr/you-feel-like-shit-an-interactive-self-care-guide/play/index.html"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interactive self-care guide</a>
                            containing very useful advice for dealing with overall suboptimal feelings. Of course,
                            pardon the coarser language that the guide and website uses; regardless, the information and
                            suggestions it contains is certainly valuable so I hope it helps on those rough days.</p>
