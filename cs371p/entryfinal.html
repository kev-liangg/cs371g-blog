                        </ul>

                        <h6> How well do you think the course conveyed those takeaways? </h6>

                        <p> 
                            All these takeaways are definitely important and Dr. Downing does his best to emphasize them across lectures while engaging with all students. That said, the overall semester website project we all worked is very detached from the lectures, and many of these takeaways are somewhat lost. The importance of testing is obviously undeniable, but testing the gui, frontend, and data/database components are a new can of worms that can be unproductive to fully approach. The points regarding algorithms, containers, decorators, and yield were explored in the lecture and exercises but there were few opportunities to apply them in our project since we were mostly working with UI/Javascript and arrays/JSON objects.                           
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, the rest of the takeaways were much more relevant. Reuse and symmetry were crucial for us in managing our source code, especially the shared logic to fetch data, sort/search/filter, and render dynamic pages. Collaboration was certainly essential as well; as a random team, we have to all learn how to work together to deliver an up-to-par product regardless of difficulties. Refactoring and beautifying our code goes without saying, as readable and elegant code goes a long way in maintainability and documentation.
                        </p>

                        <h6> Were there any other particular takeaways for you? </h6>

                        <p>
                            The main other takeaway I realized is that it’s always more difficult to have to refactor code as a retroactive endeavor. If I had the chance to code this project again, I would definitely spend a lot more conscious effort making sure everything is as symmetric and elegant as can be. Although a lot of such better practices aren’t obvious until the clarity of hindsight, making a genuine attempt will surely save a lot more inconvenience in the future and lead to a vastly improved codebase.
                        </p>

                        <h6> How did you feel about cold calling?</h6>

                        <p>
                            Cold calling was fantastic, and made the lectures so much more engaging. Learning in an open, conversation-like format really emphasizes a lot of the course takeaways, and Dr. Downing makes sure there’s never any negative pressure involved.
                        </p>

                        <h6> How did you feel about office hours? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Dr. Downing’s office hours were particularly useful for getting a sense of overall feedback focused on either website presentation or data organization. He’s seen all sorts of projects, and hence as the most solid idea on what tends to work and what tends to be troublesome. The TA lab hours are probably more useful for specific troubleshooting with source code or toolchains, since they have the most hands-on experience with the actual development.
                        </p>

                        <h6> How did you feel about lab sessions? </h6>

                        <p>
                            The format of the lab sessions with two TA’s per session was more helpful to walk through more theoretical or grading questions. It helped when the TA’s in each session were able to talk with each other to reach the best idea or solution for the students, especially when some TA’s had returning positions and were more familiar with some problems.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?</h6>

                        <p>
                            Javascript, especially the React library, is definitely the most useful tool I have learned. Going through this class has given me a significant head start in my full-stack internship this summer, and I feel it has opened a lot more career opportunities should I want to consider pursuing that focus full-time.
                        </p>


                        <h6>What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?</h6>

                        <p>
                            The most useful tool we used was <a href="https://ka-table.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ka-table</a>, a React component for our table models. It had multiple features we needed, like multisort and multifilter callbacks, as well as thorough interactive demos in the documentation. This was much better than our first attempt using Material-UI datagrid, which had those features locked behind a paywall.
                        </p>

                        <h6>How did you feel about your group having to self-teach many, many technologies?</h6> 

                        <p>
                            I felt it was extremely stressful at the time, because we not only had to learn things ourselves but also to teach other people. We all learned things at different rates as well, so there were situations where we simply all weren’t on the same page. But now that everything’s wrapped up and done, I feel it was a very rewarding experience that no other class could offer and probably prepared me the best for the workplace.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Give me your suggestions for improving the course.</h6>

                        <p>
                            I feel the course organization this semester is perfect as it is. Class participation feels fair and engaging with the quiz system. The projects comprised the bulk of the grade, which is definitely appropriate for the nature of this class. The graded exercises in place of the HackerRank exams was an extremely welcome change; it would have been overwhelming trying to cram all the lecture material when it’s so different from the projects. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            My main feedback is that there should be a system where groups can make corrections to each prior phase to regain lost points. Going through each phase can feel overwhelming with all the requirements and learning curves, and there’s a lot of room for error with everything that can go on at once. So having a bit of a safety net would be very welcome to help with that stress.
                        </p>
