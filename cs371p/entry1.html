                            Hi there, and I'm back for the third time. I'm Kevin Liang, and this is my first blog entry
                            for Fall 2021's CS371p: Object-Oriented Programming.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The hair grows longer yet. Such is the passage of time and an irrational fear of barbers.
                        </p>

                        <h6> Where did you grow up? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I was born in the winter of Sandy, Utah, and spent the next 14 years of my life near the
                            mountains there. I moved to Scottsdale, Arizona for the next 4 years of high school, though
                            I'm probably supposed to tell people I went to Phoenix instead so they don’t think I'm a
                            snobby spoiled kid.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What high school did you attend?</h6>

                        <p>
                            I attended Desert Mountain High School in Scottsdale, whoops I mean Phoenix. I graduated as
                            one of the two salutatorians in my class of about 700, and also somehow managed to get my
                            International Baccalaureate diploma as well.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your favorite extracurricular activity in
                            high school? </h6>

                        <p>
                            My main extracurriculars in high school was playing Double Bass in both the orchestra and
                            the jazz ensembles, as well as programming on my school robotics team. I don't really play
                            the Double Bass anymore because it doesn't fit in my tiny studio, but I definitely hope I'll
                            keep up programming for the forseeable future.
                        </p>

                        <h6> Why did you come to UT? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I actually originally applied to UT for Aerospace Engineering, and didn't know I wanted to
                            do Computer Science instead until my application had already been accepted. At that point I
                            figured UT was my best bet even as an out-of-state student in both departments. Hence I came
                            here to play both sides, so that way I always come on top.
                        </p>

                        <h6>
                            Why are you majoring in CS?
                        </h6>

                        <p>
                            I want to work as some sort of software developer after college, as I quite enjoy
                            programming and solving problems.
                        </p>

                        <h6> Why are you in this class? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I took this class to finish the "Dr. Downing Trifecta"; I have already completed CS371g:
                            Generic Programming and CS373: Software Engineering, so this is the last course in that
                            trio.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What are your expectations of this class? </h6>

                        <p>I expect the course to be similar to CS371g: Generic Programming. Both courses involve the
                            nuances of C++ and the HackerRank-assessed projects, and I am already very familiar with Dr.
                            Downing's workflow so I do not anticipate any surprises there.</p>

                        <h6> How much C/C++ do you already know? </h6>

                        <p>I consider C++ to be one of my main languages, and I am quite comfortable with C as well. A
                            good amount of my C++ experience came from Generic Programming as well as Dr. Gheith's
                            Operating Systems, as well as my extracurricular involvement in the Texas Rocket Engineering
                            Lab's Avionics Software Team.
                        </p>

                        <h6>How did you like the first lectures?</h6>

                        <p>
                            I enjoyed the lectures, and I always look forward to their Socratic and involved format. But
                            I'm honestly feeling very stressed over this new quiz system, undoubtedly way worse than any
                            previous Dr. Downing course. The hard cutoff will definitely bring skipped breakfasts,
                            skipped lunches, and mounting anxiety every afternoon until I manage to reach that 32
                            threshold.
                        </p>

                        <h6>How did you feel about the cold calling?</h6>

                        <p>
                            I'm very acclimated to the cold calling, and I appreciate how it helps the structure of the
                            lectures. I definitely look forward to hearing my name, and if Dr. Downing will recognize me
                            from his previous courses.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What made you happy this week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            My Summer transfer credit finally got processed, and my Interactive Degree Audit is finally
                            showing 100% completed. It's unfortuante I only get this one in-person semester before I
                            leave, but I guess it doesn't matter since I don't really go outside anyway.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>

                        <p>I type up my blog entries in Google Drive to have everything in the cloud, but its default
                            behavior of the stylistic angled quotation marks translates poorly to HTML and often results
                            in unrecognized characters where the normal, uncurved quotations are expected. There's a way
                            to fix this however, by going into Tools->Preferences and unchecking "smart quotes." This
                            will make every quotation mark and apostrophe the default unstyled version, which translates
                            much better to HTML as well as other languages.</p>
