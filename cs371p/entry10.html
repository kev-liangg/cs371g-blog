                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I didn't have to do much this past week, seeing as it was mostly our break week after the
                            project deadline. I finished up a quick and easy assignment in Symbolic Programming, and
                            then got started on some group project work in my iOS mobile computing course, as I have an
                            upcoming deadline and it's always good to get started earlier on those things. Other than
                            that, I took the time to mentally relax a bit, not being afraid to squander some time on
                            video games, socializing, sleeping in, and bouldering.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I only have the project milestone in iOS mobile computing to complete and turn in as a
                            group. The work shouldn't be too involved or difficult seeing as we have four people to
                            delegate everything, as well as a set of clearly defined deliverables that we will have to
                            figure out. We worked until the deadline on the last milestone, so hopefully we can get
                            everything packaged up with a bit more leeway this next week. I also still have to turn in
                            the next Symbolic Programming assignment, which the professor said should be fairly simple
                            and fun given that we only have a week for this one.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Besides meeting those assignment deadlines, I will probably spend more time bouldering. I'm
                            definitely feeling a lot of progression from where I started, and I don't want to get lazy.
                        </p>

                        <h6> If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #10: Dependency Inversion Principle? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I liked how the paper further built up on the principles so far, reiterating the idea of
                            clients/delegates, single responsibility, and overall abstraction. The point about
                            abstractions coming before the implementation was really important, as we're used to
                            intuitively thinking about the details first. I just wish we had more opportunities to apply
                            these principles through our coursework. We've been learning about C++ syntax and behavior
                            for so long now, and applying designs in light of OOP would certainly reinforce the learning
                            within the papers.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of iteration, functions, and heap arrays? </h6>

                        <p>
                            All of these concepts were intuitive and familiar to me, as I've used them all more or less
                            in practice. It was definitely interesting to compare and contrast how functions and
                            callables could be used in C++ with a functional language like Lisp/Clojure that I'm
                            learning in Symbolic Programming.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>


                        <p>
                            My tip-of-the-week is to listen to your body, especially to avoid tunnel vision when we're
                            in the thick of a codebase. Know the signs of dehydration headaches, and fix those with not
                            just water but also electrolytes if needed. Don't ignore hunger pangs, it's never worth
                            trying to grind away at something because that empty stomach is already hindering your
                            productivity. Take a quick break and eat something and get back on track. Be mindful of your
                            posture if you feel aches or pains, especially if you've been sitting too long working on an
                            assignment. Walk around for a bit and stretch, or even get some fresh air. We only get one
                            body so we need to take care of it as long as we're alive.
