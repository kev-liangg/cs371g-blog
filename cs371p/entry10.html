                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            This past week, I have been taking a bit of a break after finishing Phase II and my last algorithms exam, since I didn’t have anything immediately due afterwards. It definitely was nice to unwind from that combined stress and clear my head for this upcoming week.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Nothing is really in our way regarding the project, other than waiting for the grader assessment for the past phase. We were able to get to a good spot in terms of Phase II requirements all things considered, so our first priority will definitely be to address the feedback once the grades get released. 
                        </p>

                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Next week I will be working on Phase III of the project with my team. The requirements for this next phase definitely seem to center around refining what we already have, so hopefully we don’t run into too many major blockers in getting those done. There’s always the chance though that filtering or searching breaks our pagination and query models, so we will definitely start early in case we need to redesign anything.
                        </p>

                        <h6> If you read it, what did you think of the Dependency Inversion Principle? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I felt the paper was really similar to both the Liskov Substitution Principle and the Interface Segregation Principle rather than building too much on its own topic. Still, I definitely agree it was helpful to think of design in terms of explicit dependencies, and there’s nothing wrong with principles in Software Engineering building upon each other to produce the best possible code.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of +, *, ** and decorators? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I felt the overall functionality of the +, *, and ** operators were relatively straightforward, but I definitely struggled a bit during Wednesday’s exercise when it came to using and applying them. However, I don’t feel it was because the operators themselves were confusing. The main thing I missed was the ability in Python to return an uninitialized class in a function, and then later initialize that class in later code. I definitely would have never thought that was possible, as my assumption was that only initialized objects could be passed. But I suppose we did cover that everything, including types, has an address and hence is fair game to be passed around. Working with the wrapper function in the exercises definitely helped me understand decorators better as well.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

                        <p>
                            I got a Costco membership, and also booked my first therapy session for next week. 
                        </p>


                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>


                        <p>My tip of the week is <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">pandas</a>, a Python library for all things data processing.                                 
                                Everything that pandas provides is all just a fantastic and intuitive way to organize and clean any sort of data, and its Python implementation allows it to integrate perfectly with SQLAlchemy to put that processed data into the database. It’s definitely one of the top tools for data mining and data science, so I definitely recommend it for any time you have to deal with lots of information.
