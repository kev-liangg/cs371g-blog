                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I finished the correctness portion of the Allocator project within the first two hours of
                            the HackerRank opening, so it is great to get that out of the way as always. Other than
                            that, it was a constant effort to stay focused, pay attention to lectures, and meet all the
                            deadlines and progress expectations that I tried to set for myself.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I need to do the rest of the Allocator workflow requirements, and tidy up my solution a bit.
                            I currently have all my boilerplate HackerRank integration/run harness code within a single
                            main file, which obviously isn't good for unit testing. If I had done it more meticulously
                            from the ground up I likely could have caught some of those related bugs easier and saved
                            about thirty minutes of debugging time from my submission.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I will finish up Allocator before next week's deadline, and just keep trying to stay on top
                            of things. I finally wrapped up my recruiting and committed to my new grad job offer this
                            December, which comes with its own set of doubts and second thoughts. I'm just going to tell
                            myself it's all going to work out, and forget about trying to change the past or any
                            what-if's.
                        </p>

                        <h6> If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #8: Liskov Substitution Principle? </h6>

                        <p>
                            The paper definitely dragged on at times, and I wish it spent more time showing the optimal
                            designs rather than keep poking at the shortcomings and pitfalls of the examples it listed.
                            The whole rectangle/square definitely continued for way too long. I liked the real-world Set
                            example the author provided with his personal insight, although I disliked how he breezed
                            over the final design solution. It would have definitely been more interesting to see that
                            elaborated and explain its use cases and how it affected the public behavior of the system.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of Arrays and Allocator? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Arrays were conceptually simple, though the lectures went a bit more in-depth than what I
                            was expecting. I will probably need to look through the notes and the examples one more time
                            to fully understand what was going on. Allocator, on the other hand, was a fun project and I
                            was able to fully implement it in no time. Working with memory is definitely something that
                            is well-ingrained to me in the scope of C++ so getting that solution implemented was a
                            breeze.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

                        <p>
                            I'm feeling less hopeless than last week, so that's good.
                        </p>


                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>


                        <p>When it comes to navigating the industry and job hunting, one of the most important parts is
                            the negotiation process. I think our career center sometimes sends out emails on how to
                            navigate job offers that mention some negotiation tips, but I personally think it should be
                            a much bigger deal than that. Not negotiating simply leaves money on the table, and we all
                            like free money. As part of my online reading on the matter, I saw
                            <a href="https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a>. be commonly passed around. It was very
                            helpful and it indeed works, as it convinced me to negotiate for a sign-on bonus and get
                            essentially free money for just a few minutes of a phone call.
                        </p>
