                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            This past week, I mostly focused on a team deliverable deadline for my iOS programming
                            course, which I was able to get completed quite successfully. There were definitely a lot of
                            roadblocks given the unfamiliar subject matter and working with cryptic, non-documented
                            bugs, but I had started early enough where I had enough time to work everything out before
                            the deadline. I also had to study for my only midterm this week, which went well; it was
                            still an open-note and open-internet exam but studying the material beforehand let me move
                            through quicker and have more time for all the questions.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I need to finish up the remaining workflow, submission, and unit testing tasks for Project
                            3: Allocator since I already completed the HackerRank portion for correctness. Learning from
                            my last project, I was more mindful in setting up the codebase according to the project spec
                            and building unit tests to test for correctness alongside the HackerRank debugging, so it
                            shouldn't take that much more time.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            After finishing up the Allocator tasks by Monday, I'll likely jump back into the iOS
                            programming course and continue on the deliverable tasks for this next two-week work period.
                            I also didn't put in any work hours this week so I will probably try to catch up on some
                            hours there so I can get some of those hours back and get paid again.
                        </p>

                        <h6> If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #8: Interface Segregation Principle? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I felt the paper addressed an important part of designing programs, and I liked the robust
                            examples of the problematic patterns and the best practices. I actually suspected a good
                            amount of overlap with the Single Responsibility Principle and even perhaps the Liskov
                            Substitution Principle but I wasn't too sure. It would be nice to have a bit of confirmation
                            on that, maybe as we practice applying more of these principles as I would expect in this
                            course.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of algorithms and iterators? </h6>

                        <p>
                            The algorithms were all simple, especially in terms of iterators. And since I was already
                            very familiar with Iterators from my other courses, I didn't have any problems grasping both
                            concepts as well as implementing the necessary iterator for Allocator.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

                        <p>
                            I restocked my freezer with Costco frozen foods, so that should at least take care of a lot
                            of meal planning and sustenance for the next month hopefully.
                        </p>


                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>


                        <p>One of my friends set up <a
                                href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Remote Desktop</a> on his iPad and
                            was able to access his personal computer and hence SSH into the lab machines from there.
                            It's definitely cool being able to access a full code/text editor from handheld devices,
                            with any of the client providers and setup from the Microsoft documentation.
