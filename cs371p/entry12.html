                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            This past week was mostly a break week for me. I didn't have any immediate or pressing
                            deadlines, and all my upcoming ones would be fairly simple to complete. It was definitely
                            nice being able to mentally recharge after some particular deadlines I had the prior weeks,
                            and still have some time left over on this weekend to ramp up my productivity.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I need to finish some file and design refactoring since the Darwin project spec was updated.
                            I'm no longer worried about correctness since I know my program now behaves correctly, but I
                            do need to split the header files for each class component and reorganize some of the
                            behavior delegation. After that, it should just be a matter of completing the UML file and
                            the rest of the workflow tasks before turning it in by Monday's deadline.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Next week, I will finish all the above tasks with regards to our Darwin project. After that,
                            I'll likely spend the remaining time on a Symbolic Programming assignment and making more
                            progress on my iOS group project.
                        </p>

                        <h6> If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #12: More Getters and Setters? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Overall I was able to comprehend the overall message of this paper that built on from last
                            week. I wasn't too much of a fan of a lot of the passages relating to Java UI jargon as that
                            was unfamiliar to me and probably quite dated at this point. The source code examples were
                            helpful though, so I wish the summary passages focused more on outlining those fundamental
                            design patterns rather than throwing in too much UI terminology.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of initializations, copy constructor, copy assignment, move
                            constructor, and move assignment? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I got a bit confused with initializations with regard to copy initialization vs direct
                            initialization, but I realize it's fundamentally a matter of permissiveness when it comes to
                            specifying that explicit keyword or otherwise. Copy constructors and copy assignments were
                            very straightforward, especially since we had to implement them with the Vector exercise. It
                            follows that move constructors and move assignments also made sense, as I was able to
                            compare and contrast them to the copy functionality.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

                        <p>
                            It feels crazy that I'll be graduating in less than 5 weeks now, but I'm definitely ready to
                            close out this semester and my time at UT.
                        </p>


                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>

                        <p>
                            My tip-of-the-week is to try counting calories and macros, regardless of your fitness goals.
                            There are many choices of apps that make this easy, and most of the popular ones should have
                            comprehensive databases containing the nutritional value of all sorts of foods. Even if
                            you're not on a specific diet, tracking the foods you typically consume if only for a week
                            can help identify any imbalances in nutrients. It's always good to try to keep as balanced
                            of a diet as possible, and taking proactive steps to do so has definitely helped me feel
                            more physically and mentally fresh.
                        </p>
