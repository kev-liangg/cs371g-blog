                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            This past week, I made great progress with my team on the single-column sorting, filtering, and searching part of the Phase III requirements . After resolving a few grading issues, we were all happy with our performance in the last phase and have a solid foundation of work to move forward and complete everything.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Just over the weekend, AWS decided to terminate one of our EC2 cloud-compute instances which completely broke our backend environment. I have been troubleshooting that extensively, both fixing the issue as well as reconfiguring our project so that never happens again. I suspect it was because we used spot instances in our load balancer, and possibly unforeseen (and malicious?) circumstances at AWS servers made it such that other hosted applications used up all of the available spot instances leaving nothing for us.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Once I resolve our computing instances issue, I will work with my team to finish multi-column filter and whole-database searching. We also need to do a lot of work on our presentation of the website, both the UX and the UI. Indeed, we all classified ourselves as full-stack developers so we definitely have all our work cut out for us across the entire website.
                        </p>

                        <h6> If you read it, what did you think of the Why getter and setter methods are evil? </h6>

                        <p>
                            This is definitely my favorite paper so far. Relevantly, it makes so much sense with all the meticulous interfaces I need to understand with third-party Typescript components. I now know why all the types are defined as interfaces of interfaces of interfaces and it’s all for the benefit of me, the user of the code! I definitely wish we would have learned the “full field encapsulation” concept earlier possibly in Data Structures, as it’s clearly a very important part in object oriented design.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of select, project, cross join and theta join? </h6>

                        <p>
                            All of the relation operations made perfect sense to me, in both their use and their implementation. I have a good bit of experience working with data relations from my Data Mining course so the overall usage was definitely familiar. Still, it was interesting seeing the very Pythonic implementations of the backing code that accomplished the operations.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

                        <p>
                            I finally received my license to carry, and I’ve wasted no time in getting accustomed to this new lifestyle. I’ve been quite shaken up by the constant rise in Asian hate crimes that the news has just recently decided is worth reporting. Even if I’m less likely to be targeted as a victim as a younger male, after training and practicing for so long I’m definitely glad that I finally have the official and legal means to defend myself and more vulnerable groups.
                        </p>


                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>

                        <p>Our team ran into issues in AWS with our backend application/environment and the database, where we mistakenly linked our environment instance with the database instance. This caused an unwanted dependency where we had to delete our entire database when the environment crashed.

                            helped me understand what the actual relationship should have been, and it’s definitely applicable to overall systems where you have these sorts of connections between components.
