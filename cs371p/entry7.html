                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            This past week, I finished up the remaining workflow tasks and submitted our Project 2:
                            Voting. It was definitely straightforward to complete, though the unit tests were a bit more
                            tedious than I would have liked. Next time, I'll try to build up my unit tests as I develop
                            and debug the solution rather than "unit testing" through HackerRank's correctness.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

                        <p>
                            Project deadlines, as usual. But I've been dealing with a lot more mental stress than usual,
                            probably a combination of all sorts of things going on. I know I messed up both the last two
                            quizzes, and I even missed a hard deadline for an easy, completion-grade assignment this
                            week. I haven't been able to concentrate on school, and it's been even harder to find the
                            mental energy to eat or drink or take care of myself.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I'd like to try to convince myself that things will be okay, but I probably won't have time
                            to do that given my current productivity levels.

                        </p>

                        <h6> If you read it, what did you think of the Paper #7: Open-Closed Principle? </h6>

                        <p>
                            It was quite insightful, and I liked the examples it provided. I wish it went more in-depth
                            on the OrderedObject/OrderedShape hierarchy it mentioned at the end of that example though,
                            as it would have been useful to see how multiple inheritance would play out when it comes to
                            designing an ideal closed system.
                        </p>

                        <h6> What was your experience of arguments, returns, and consts? </h6>

                        <p>
                            I understood all of these concepts, mostly due to past familiarity and application. The only
                            thing that was a bit confusing was the whole const casting and whatnot, and when to actually
                            use it if it can lead to undefined behavior/runtime errors if a caller is evil.
                        </p>

                        <h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

                        <p>
                            Too stressed to feel happy.
                        </p>


                        <h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>


                        <p>
                            I guess it helps to type out your problems and your feelings and to have some sort of avenue
                            to rant about things, but also have it such that doing so doesn't impact your personal life
                            as much. Nobody wants to say it, but honestly, we all know it's better to not bother your
                            friends and be a burden. We don't have to pretend and play along saying "oh you're not
                            bothering me" when we both know that's not true. So that rules out a lot of ways to talk
                            about things, so it's good that we have the anonymous internet as an option to air things
                            out.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Obviously this blog isn't anonymous, but it's not like anyone is really reading this anyway.
                            If you're the next person on the Ed list, I know you're only skimming the blog to find
                            something to comment about. And if you're the grader, I know you're only skimming to make
                            sure all the sections are there and the word count seems right. The reality is we all have
                            bigger things to deal with, and we don't need the pressure to pretend to care about some
                            other nobody who's taking this course.
