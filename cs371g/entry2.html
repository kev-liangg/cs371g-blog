                        <h6> What did you do this past week? </h6>

                        <p>
                        This last week, I completed the first Perusall submission 
			on Continuous Integration. I made sure to put my full attention 
			into reading the paper and writing my annotations, as I feel 
			that the topic is very applicable to software development in 
			any industry. Although I have a good understanding of the Collatz 
			project, I did not begin the actual code until late this weekend 
			as I needed the time to catch up on a personal project.                        
			</p>
                        
                        <h6> What's in your way? </h6>

			<p>
			In terms of coursework, nothing is in my way yet. I was able to install all the 
			required tools on WSL, which I plan to use for my development environment for 
			the rest of this class. I did not run into any issues so far following the 
			workflow documentation to set up the Collatz project, and I am fairly confident 
			in the rest of the work to be done. That said, I will definitely remain 
			vigilant and give myself enough time to debug any future unintended issues 
			that will inevitably occur.
			</p>

                        <p>
                        However, my main obstacles are my suboptimal sleeping habits and my poor 
			diet, both of which are solely my fault. I have not been able to get enough 
			sleep before each lecture, and likewise, I do not have enough time to eat 
			anything. As a result, I am usually exhausted throughout the rest of the 
			day, which then usually causes me to lose my appetite. I tend to get 
			nauseous when I am hungry, but I have a hard time eating because of that 
			nausea. The combination of these factors can make it somewhat difficult 
			for me to stay productive.                        
			</p>
                        
                        <h6> What will you do next week? </h6>
                        
                        <p>
                        For the beginning of next week, I will have to prioritize the 
			remaining work on the Collatz project, even if it means falling 
			behind again on my personal work. Should the third Perusall 
			paper be assigned, I also plan to start and complete my 
			annotations earlier than usual in order to better distribute 
			my future workload.                        
			</p>
                                                
                        <h6> What was your experience of assertions, unit tests, pointers, and references? </h6>
                        
                        <p>
                        I mostly understand assertions and their proper use, though 
			until now I never had the thought to incorporate them into my 
			programs. On the other hand, I am very accustomed to unit tests, 
			pointers, and references. All of my prior extracurricular team 
			projects required me to write unit tests for Continuous Integration, 
			and I have always used both pointers and references for my code in C++.                        
			</p>
                                                
                        <h6> How are you doing and holding up? What's been most helpful for you in 
			terms of support at this time? </h6>
                        
                        <p>
                        Besides those few physical and mental issues, I'm doing mostly alright. 
			Of course, there is room for improvement in my habits, and at the end of the day I know I must 
			hold myself accountable for that. In terms of support, regular naps have helped me fight off 
			my exhaustion, and I am doing some research to see if there is an 
			over-the-counter medication that could further support me through this class.                        
			</p>
                        
			<h6> What made you happy this week? </h6>

			<p>
			I was able to spend more time than usual with my closest friends this week, 
			which was only possible through an online voice call. We had all started 
			playing a simple game together, and as silly as it may be, it made me 
			feel included and genuinely happy to have the same shared interest with them.
			</p>
                        
                        <h6> What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? </h6>
                        
                        <p>
                        When I was first starting C++ development, I remember spending a lot of time 
			comprehending the intimidating double-pointer and reference-to-pointer 
			syntaxes. Although I haven't used either case regularly since then, 
			this week's lecture on pointers and references reminded me of their existence.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        I figured it would be a good idea to revisit my understanding with a new 
			perspective in this class, and 
			<a href="https://www.codeguru.com/cpp/cpp/cpp_mfc/pointers/article.php/c4089/PointertoPointer-and-ReferencetoPointer.htm">
			this article</a> does a good job of explaining the concept. In the end, it 
			helped me the most to just think of the first pointer-asterisk as a fixed data 
			type, which we 	can then choose to pass-by-reference or pass-by-pointer in the 
			function parameters.
			</p>
