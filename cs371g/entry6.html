						<h6>What did you do this past week?</h6>

						<p>This past week, I completed the Integer project and started
							working on the Deque implementation due next week. I also
							finished reading and annotating the assigned article about "The
							Joel Test," a humorous and well-written basic checklist for
							better code development. Although it was originally written two
							decades ago, all of the material still seems very relevant for
							any software company; certainly, there are still companies out
							there that would not pass the test at all.</p>

						<h6>What's in your way?</h6>

						<p>My teammate and I still have a lot of work left on the Deque
							assignment. We have a good understanding of the higher-level
							concept of the Deque the iterator behaviors, but we still have
							not figured out how to use the allocators to actually store the
							data.</p>

						<h6>What will you do next week?</h6>

						<p>Next week, my partner and I will likely look through the
							implementation of Vector closely in order to adapt the code to
							work with elements in a Deque. Hopefully that shouldn't take
							long to figure out, which means we can correctly implement more
							of the intended behavior of our Deque.</p>

						<h6>What was your experience of Vector and Deque nature?</h6>

						<p>I have a solid conceptual understanding of both the Vector
							and Deque, including both of their use cases and the practical
							differences between them. However, the current project of
							implementing the Deque still challenges my comprehension. In the
							end, I know I will have a far greater understanding of both
							concepts after meticulously parsing through the given
							implementation of Vector and constructing the actual code behind
							a Deque.</p>

						<h6>How are you doing and holding up? What's been most
							helpful for you in terms of support at this time?</h6>

						<p>I've been feeling relatively insignificant at times, but
							other than that I'm not doing too badly. The last project
							required a lot of mental effort, and the current project seems
							even more difficult, so I expect that things will go downhill
							from here. As for support, I've found it helpful to greatly
							increase the intensity of my workouts. I have been forcing myself
							to add more repetitions with minimal rest periods in order to
							take advantage of those negative emotions.</p>

						<h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

						<p>I started watching an older TV comedy series with a couple
							of my friends. I really enjoy the humor and the characters, and I
							am happy we have been able to share many laughs together that
							way.</p>

						<h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>

						<p>Sometimes writing good code isn't all about style. In the
							case of C++, there are many destructive behaviors that compilers
							cannot detect, with some more obvious than others. To help with
							that, a company called Perforce developed the 
							<a href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/high-integrity-cpp-hicpp">High Integrity C++</a>
							(HIC++) coding standard.</p>


						<p>This standard is a list of best practices in order
							to write high-quality and safe C++. There are other popular
							standards as well, with a lot of the rules overlapping
							between them. For example, 
							<a href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/jsf-coding-standard-cpp">JSF AV C++</a>
							is another coding standard from the development of the F35 Joint
							Strike Fighter. Although this class has slightly lower stakes
							than a 5th-generation stealth fighter jet, it might still be a good
							idea to refer to these standards to produce the safest code.
