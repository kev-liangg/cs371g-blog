						<h6>What did you do this past week?</h6>

						<p>This past week, I completed and submitted the Collatz
							project. I also annotated and read the assigned papers regarding
							Cultural Competence and Pair Programming. Most recently, I spent
							time familiarizing myself with the upcoming Netflix project,
							mostly by studying the file formats in preparation to build the
							necessary caches.</p>

						<h6>What's in your way?</h6>

						<p>The main thing in my way will probably be building the
							GitLab repository for the Netflix project from scratch since we
							are not provided a public repo this time. In the proper spirit of
							Pair Programming, I plan to set up the makefile and GitLab CI
							configuration alongside my partner in order to avoid mistakes and
							gain a shared understanding of the topics. The rest of the
							project seems relatively straightforward from the requirements,
							although my partner and I both predicted it will take more time
							than the previous due to the wider scope of the problem and
							optimizations.</p>

						<h6>What will you do next week?</h6>

						<p>I plan to continue working on the Netflix project with my
							partner, and hopefully run into issues sooner than later so we
							can get assistance during office hours. I also plan to begin
							studying for the first exam the following week. Although I am
							very confident in all of the material covered so far, I want to
							review everything separately in order to catch the more tricky
							and obscure cases.</p>

						<h6>What was your experience of exceptions, consts, and Boost
							serialization?</h6>

						<p>Exceptions were familiar to me from my Java experience. The
							behavior of the try/catch blocks seemed about the same, although
							the different types of catch statements took some time to fully
							understand. From my previous C++ experience as well, I understood
							the idea of const variables, const pointers, and const
							references. The use of const after a pointer was new to me, but
							it made sense after thinking of it as an immutable reference.
							Finally, const structs, functions, and expressions were new to me
							as well, but I was able to figure them all out quickly with some
							outside sources after the lecture.</p>

						<p>I was able to comprehend the reasoning and advantages
							behind Boost serialization as presented in the lecture as well,
							but its actual usage didn't make sense to me. I plan to search
							for specific use cases to follow as examples when building the
							caches for the Netflix project, which should help me with my
							understanding there.</p>

						<h6>How are you doing and holding up? What's been most
							helpful for you in terms of support at this time?</h6>

						<p>I am doing better than last week. I have been making an
							effort to sleep earlier on the days before class so I can wake up
							earlier to study for the quizzes and eat breakfast. Over the
							week, food has been the most helpful in supporting me. I bought a
							large pack of spicy instant noodles for quick and easy meals in
							the mornings. I also started going out for drives and getting
							comfort food like Wendy's and Taco Bell, which is always a good
							break from the stress at home.</p>

						<h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

						<p>I finally spent the money to purchase several pieces of
							gear and equipment for a competitive hobby of mine, which I am
							really excited about. The current situation has caused a
							significant delay in the shipping times, but I am still looking
							forward to the day when they finally arrive.</p>

						<h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>

						<p>
							My pick-of-the-week is Eclipse's C++ debugger, as it has helped
							me identify and fix all of my bugs in the Collatz projects. If
							you've ever used the built-in Eclipse debugger for Java projects,
							the interface is essentially the same. My main system is Windows,
							so I had to install <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a> and
							use Eclipse's auto-generated build settings instead of the
							makefile.
						</p>


						<p>
							Once I got the code running equivalently, the Eclipse debugger
							allowed me to easily set breakpoints, monitor variables, and
							track function calls all within a comfortable GUI. The <a
								href="https://help.eclipse.org/2020-06/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.cdt.doc.user%2Fgetting_started%2Fcdt_w_debug.htm">
								official Eclipse documentation</a> gives basic step-by-step
							instructions, though I found it more helpful watching Walter
							Schilling's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThYE5IllvB0">
								video tutorial</a> on the topic. I also found <a
								href="https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/april/article2.php">this
								article</a> by Tracy Miranda about more advanced debugging features
							that I didn't know about before. It would have been really
							helpful to have known about them during the Collatz project, but
							at least they can be of use in the future now.
