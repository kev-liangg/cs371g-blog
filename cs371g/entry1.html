                        Hello, I'm Kevin Liang, and this is my first blog entry 
                        for Summer 2020's CS371g: Generic Programming.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        I've decided to use my personal webpage as a platform, 
                        which hopefully will help me gain more experience with 
                        frontend development.                        
                        </p> 
						
                        <h6> Where did you grow up? </h6>

                        <p>
                        I spent the first fourteen years of my life in Utah, in 
                        the suburbs of the Salt Lake City area. After I finished 
                        middle school, my family moved to Scottsdale, Arizona. 
                        There, I attended Desert Mountain High School and 
                        graduated under the International Baccalaureate Diploma 
                        Programme. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <h6> What was your favorite extracurricular activity in 
                        high school? </h6>

                        <p>
                        In my senior year, a friend asked me to consider joining 
                        the school's First Robotics Competition (FRC) Team, 
                        #6314. The team's only student programmer from last 
                        season had quit, and they needed someone who could 
                        write and update the codebase for the new robot. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Although I was currently enrolled in the AP Computer 
                        Science course at the time, I had no prior programming 
                        experience. I was initially unsure if I was fit for the 
                        task, but I am glad I made the choice to join. My time 
                        on the team allowed me to learn, practice, and implement 
                        Java in a practical setting, and it was one of the major 
                        factors that sparked my interest in Computer Science.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h6> Why did you come to UT Austin? </h6>
                        
                        <p>
                        I actually had finished all my college applications 
                        before I realized that I wanted to pursue Computer 
                        Science. I was accepted into a few schools for my old 
                        choice of Aerospace Engineering, which included UT. 
                        When it was time to make a decision later, I knew that 
                        Computer Science was the right major for me. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        However, the admissions process at UT Austin meant I was 
                        locked into Aerospace Engineering for my freshman year. 
                        I read that both programs at UT were both very 
                        competitive, which made the school seem like the safest 
                        choice in case I couldn't change my major. Fortunately, 
                        I was able to transfer into the Computer Science 
                        department here.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h6> Why are you in this class? </h6>
                        
                        <p>
                        For one reason or another, I wasn't able to secure an 
                        internship for this summer. I still wanted to remain 
                        productive, so I figured it would be a good idea to 
                        enroll in an online class and get further ahead with my 
                        degree plan.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        This class is also my first Computer Science elective. 
                        To be quite honest, I don't really know how many 
                        upper-division courses I should be taking each semester 
                        to graduate on time. All I know is that I'll be taking 
                        Operating Systems in the upcoming fall semester, which 
                        I am sure will be an experience I won't easily forget 
                        for the rest of my life.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h6> How much C++ do you already know? </h6>
                        
                        <p>
                        I am relatively experienced with C++, as I have used the 
                        language over the past year with my software development position at 
                        the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/texas-rocket-engineering-lab/">
                        Texas Rocket Engineering Lab</a>. Correspondingly, my 
                        knowledge of the language is mostly practical. I have 
                        written most of the code there to fulfill technical 
                        specifications and to interface with the ground mission  
                        control, hardware components, and central flight 
                        computers of a spacefaring rocket. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        The only other external tool/library I have used is 
                        <a href = "https://cpputest.github.io/">CppUTest</a>, so 
                        I am excited to learn more about Boost, Google Test, and 
                        Valgrind. I feel it is optimal for any programmer to be 
                        familiar with a wide variety of tools. That way, 
                        he or she can make educated decisions when choosing one 
                        over another, and better adapt to the requirements of 
                        different companies and industry standards.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h6> What's your pick-of-the-week? </h6>
                        
                        <p>
                        I was going through my current development environment, 
                        and I just saw that WSL 2 had just released last month. 
                        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about"
                        >WSL</a> itself stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux, and 
                        essentially simulates a Linux environment on a Windows 
                        machine with very little overhead. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        I have been using the previous, first version of WSL 
                        from the start. It is much more lightweight and quicker 
                        than dual-booting and any dedicated virtual machine, 
                        providing an exceptionally streamlined experience. WSL 
                        has allowed me to easily access and install tools such 
                        as gcc, g++, Valgrind, and more for use with my projects. 
                        And with the recent release of the WSL 2, not only is it 
                        faster but it can now support the full Linux kernel and 
                        full system call compatibility.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        I definitely recommend WSL for any developer on a 
                        Windows device, and I certainly will continue to use it 
                        for this course.
                        </p>
