						<h6>What did you do this past week?</h6>

						<p>This last week, I completed the Netflix assignment with my
							partner. We were able to reach an RMSE of about .9695 by using
							only the average of all the ratings of each individual and movie.
							We wanted to see if we could reach the extra credit goal of .95
							by using another cache, but we ran out of time before we could
							fully implement that solution. I also began reviewing the notes
							for the earlier topics in the class and finished the summary for
							the assigned presentation on Ethics for Computer Science</p>

						<h6>What's in your way?</h6>

						<p>Nothing is in my way. I am very confident in all of the new
							material covered so far in the course, and I plan to keep up my
							review schedule to solidify my mastery when the exam comes on
							Wednesday.</p>

						<h6>What will you do next week?</h6>

						<p>As mentioned above, for the next week I will continue to
							study for the first test. I will probably go through the
							comprehensive list of topics and review every one of them in
							order to ensure nothing slips through. I will also look at code
							snippets for a better understanding of the proper syntax as well
							as the trickier cases of improper usage and undefined behavior.</p>

						<h6>What was your experience of RMSE, lambdas, function
							objects, Boost serialization, and iterators?</h6>

						<p>I understand both the concepts of RMSE and Boost
							serialization after using them both to complete the Netflix
							assignment. That said, I am still curious about the
							implementation and algorithm underneath Boost serialization, as
							my understanding mainly pertained to the use cases of compiling
							the libraries and reading the binaries. Serialization seems like
							an interesting topic as a whole, and it partially reminds me of
							the Huffman compression project from my Data Structures course.</p>

						<p>Lambdas were fairly new to me, as I did not use them very
							much in Java either. I took some time to look at more examples
							outside of the transform function, which helped me understand
							their proper syntax and usage. Iterators were more familiar
							because I have used them in C++ before, though I am less
							experienced with the underlying concepts such as iterator_traits.</p>

						<p>Finally, function objects were the most confusing to me,
							though only at first. After doing some more reading on that
							topic, they made much more sense to me. It was mainly seeing
							their usage and structure for the first time that caught me off
							guard, despite their simple requirement for implementation.</p>

						<h6>How are you doing and holding up? What's been most
							helpful for you in terms of support at this time?</h6>

						<p>I am doing better than usual. The upcoming exam has given
							me something to mentally focus my efforts on, which has been
							helpful during these times. As always, I am thankful for my
							friends for support, and I am fortunate to be able to continue
							talking with them through online measures.</p>

						<h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

						<p>I redownloaded a virtual one-versus-one card game
							called Hearthstone after a two-year break. I was able to create a
							deck that is enjoyable for me, but absolutely not for my
							opponents. I have received some angry messages after winning
							games, which is completely understandable. The strategy relies on
							a completely unfair "combo" that can instantly win a game from
							any disadvantage, which makes me very happy every time it
							happens.</p>

						<h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>

						<p>As I previously mentioned, I have been quite curious about the
							inner workings of Boost serialization. I tried looking for any
							further explanations for the algorithm, but I was actually not
							able to find anything. However, I did discover that Java has its
							own version of serialization for objects.</p>


						<p><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2072752/the-java-serialization-algorithm-revealed.html">This article</a>
							thoroughly explains the algorithm behind serialization used
							within Java, from the higher-level syntax to the lowest storage bytes of
							the serialized object. Overall, it was a very interesting read
							and presented an insightful perspective of practical data
							management and processing in the scope of programming.
