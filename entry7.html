						<h6>What did you do this past week?</h6>

						<p>This past week, my partner and I completed the Deque
							assignment by mostly fixing bugs in memory allocation caused by
							other people's unit tests. We were able to pass all of the valid
							tests in the public repository without any memory leaks at all,
							which was a relief given how much time we put into the project.</p>
							
							<p>I also annotated the assigned paper on Agile methodology. I
							had a general sense of what Agile was from an engineering student
							organization, and it was especially insightful to read this
							perspective from 2005 and compare how the principle seems to have
							evolved over time.</p>

						<h6>What's in your way?</h6>

						<p>Nothing is in my way. I started the Graph project with my
							partner and we have already made solid progress on the assignment
							without any trouble. I am also not particularly worried about the
							upcoming exam, though it wouldn't hurt to start reviewing the
							notes sooner than later.</p>

						<h6>What will you do next week?</h6>

						<p>My partner and I will likely finish the current Graph
							project early next week to get it out of the way. After that, I
							will use the extra time to begin studying for the last exam. My
							preparation strategy from the last exam worked very well, so I
							likely won't do anything new. My plan is still to review the
							notes and corresponding code fragments, which should ensure that
							I can implement the necessary algorithms and structures during
							the exam.</p>

						<h6>What was your experience of stack, back_insert_iterator, and graph?</h6>

						<p>The concepts of the stack and the graph were very
							straightforward, as I still remember them from Data Structures
							and Discrete Math. In the in-class exercise for
							back_insert_iterator, I had the idea to implement the dereference
							operator to push_back onto the vector and return the back()
							reference, but I didn't realize the clever optimization in using
							the assignment operator until it was brought up in lecture. The
							implementation also helped me realize the important purpose of an
							initializer list within the constructor when correctly
							initializing a reference.</p>

						<h6>How are you doing and holding up? What's been most
							helpful for you in terms of support at this time?</h6>

						<p>I am doing well since the Deque project is finally over. I
							wasn't necessarily stressed and I did find the project enjoyable,
							but it was overall a lot of work and I felt a bit pressured by
							time towards the end with the new unit tests seemingly revealing
							another bug and edge case that needed to be fixed. In the end, my
							partner and I were able to take care of everything which has been
							a major source of relief. I am feeling very confident in these
							final weeks of the class, and I have certainly learned a lot
							since the very first day.</p>

						<h6>What made you happy this week?</h6>

						<p>A group of friends and I participated in the "Black Lives
							Matter Game Jam" hosted by the "Electronic Game Developer's
							Society." Although I never really had a particular interest in
							game development, I figured it would be a fun experience. Even
							with all the coding failures, stressful time crunches, and the
							desperate all-nighter to turn the unfinished game into a
							PowerPoint Presentation, it still ended up being pretty fun in
							hindsight. I don't care that we weren't able to make an "actual
							game" since the real game was the funny moments we had along the
							way.</p>

						<h6>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h6>

						<p>Have you ever joined a "Game Jam" hosted by the "Electronic
							Game Developer's Society" and then realize that you have no idea
							how to even write code for a game? Is the simplest "Linear
							Point-and-Click Visual Novel genre of Electronic Game" too
							complex for you to program?</p>

						<p>Well, my answer to both these questions is a resounding "YES!"
							And as someone who has answered a resounding "YES!" to both those
							questions, I can wholeheartedly endorse 
							<a href="https://www.google.com/slides/about/">Google Slides</a> as your
							solution! Google Slides has singlehandedly allowed me and my team
							to make a questionable amalgamation of a "Linear Point-and-Click
							Visual Novel genre of Electronic Game," and I didn't even have to
							pay an overly-excessive amount of blood, sweat, and tears to do
							so!</p>

						<p>
							The trick is to use the <a
								href=https://slidesgo.com/slidesgo-school/google-slides-tutorials/how-to-add-hyperlinks-in-google-slides>linking
								feature</a> within Google Slides. Normally, clicking anywhere in the
							slide would advance to the next slide. If you don't want that to
							happen, just draw a huge transparent rectangle over the whole
							slide and make it link to the current slide. Fixed! Then you can
							add buttons or options to link to any other slide in the
							presentation and have the game progress that way!
						</p>

						<p>And all this can be done without writing a single line of
							code! The linking process is all done through the concept of
							"Pointing and Clicking" just like the gameplay you're
							encouraging! You just have to mentally keep track of all the
							slides and make sure everything links together correctly, or
							everything will explode. Don't let that intimidate you! It's just
							like drawing a 45-element jump table in x86 using MS Paint, but it's even easier
							because you don't have to know any x86!</p>
